The Operator Foundation released a new documentation for Shapeshifter Dispatcher which provides the most detailed and clear explanation of how to run Shapeshifter Dispatcher with Obfs4 transport. Obfs4 transport provides better obfuscation quality with a faster performance. 

The newly published document includes previously undocumented information on how to obtain the obfs4 “cert” parameter, which is necessary for configuring an obfs4 transport client.

The document can be found ***[Here under "Running with obfs4"](https://github.com/OperatorFoundation/shapeshifter-dispatcher/blob/master/README.md)
