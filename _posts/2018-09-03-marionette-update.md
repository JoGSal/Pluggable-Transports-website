There's been a major update to Redjack's [Marionette](https://www.github.com/redgjack/marionette) on Github. The repository, which contains a Go port of the programmable network proxy, has been updated to fix some issues with active probing defenses, and now also includes extensive documentation.

The docs give step-by-step instructions for using Marionette, from building simple "Hello World" protocols through to full application simulations.
