I"‘<p>Internews is pleased to announce the second round of the Small Grants program for projects involving pluggable transports.</p>

<p>The following activities are eligible for funding:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Development of new transports which do not rely on domain fronting. Transports must conform to the <a href="https://github.com/Pluggable-Transports/Pluggable-Transports-spec">2.x spec</a> and provide a self-assessment based on the Evaluation Criteria here: (https://www.pluggabletransports.info/build/). (If there is a good reason the PT you are working on cannot adhere to the PT 2.x spec, please add an explanatory comment when submitting your application.) Preference will be given to projects able to be deployable by the end of the grant period..</li>
  <li>Updating existing transports to the 2.x spec</li>
  <li>Implementing pluggable transports in applications providing security, privacy, or access to information; in particular, taking advantage of the UDP options of the 2.x spec to support voice, video, and VPN traffic
The deadline for the second round of submissions is <strong>August 1st, 2021</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If any funds remain, applications will be evaluated on a rolling basis. Grants can be up to 6 months in duration, with the potential for extension. Projects should aim for a budget under $30,000 USD but exceptions can be made.</p>
