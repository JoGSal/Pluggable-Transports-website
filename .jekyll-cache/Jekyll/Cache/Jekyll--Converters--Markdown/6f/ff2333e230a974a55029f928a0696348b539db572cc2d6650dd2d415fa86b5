I"<p>The process of updating the Pluggable Transport Specification Document (PT Spec) is still ongoing. Recently Dr. Brandon Wiley of the Operator foundation released an updated version 2.0 Draft 2, of the Spec which answers different issues in the previous spec. 
In the new draft, new terminologies were introduced and others were removed to offer more clarity and to differentiate between numbers of PT Spec elements. Unused examples were removed and others were improved with cleaner code and better descriptions.</p>
