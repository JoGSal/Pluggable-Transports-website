I"*<p>The current version of the Pluggable Transports specification is <a href="https://github.com/Pluggable-Transports/Pluggable-Transports-spec">here</a>, and is at version 2.1</p>

<p>We are now looking for community input for revising the specification. There are already some comments on Github. These proposed changes will also be distributed via the Network Traffic Obfuscation community <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/traffic-obf">mailing list</a> in order to collect feedback and reflect them on the next version of the spec.</p>
