I"Õ<p>Calyx recently <a href="https://calyxinstitute.org/news/were-improving-calyxvpn">made an announcement</a> that they are adding support for Pluggable Transports to their product <a href="https://calyx.net/">CalyxVPN</a>.</p>

<p>CalyxVPN is a free VPN tool that helps people access information in places where content may be censored, provided by <a href="https://www.calyxinstitute.org/">The Calyx Institute</a>. The team will be working with developers from the <a href="https://leap.se/">LEAP Encryption Access Project</a>, which will also lead to other VPNs that use the Bitmask client being able to benefit from this work.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more announcements as our other funded projects get off the ground!</p>
