I"¶	<p><em>Edited on March 18 to add translator credits</em></p>

<p>To better serve our international community of developers, we have launched new content on this site in seven additioanl languages. Weâ€™ve started with the comic strip and introductory paragraph that people see when accessing the site, and also our Getting Started guide. The languages we have chosen are: Spanish, Turkish, Russian, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Farsi and Arabic.</p>

<p>The translation efforts were provided by <a href="https://www.localizationlab.org/">Localization Lab</a>, whose network of translators and reviewers worked quickly and efficiently to deliver great content across all languages. While there were some difficult words and concepts to tackle, weâ€™re all really pleased with the end results, and thank Localization Lab for doing such amazing work.</p>

<p>While much of our documentation is still in English, we hope that this move will make Pluggable Transports accessible and understandable for a much wider group of people. To access our Getting Started guide in languages other than English, you can click the languge button on the <a href="/">front page of our site</a>, or on the first page of any of the Getting Started guides.</p>
