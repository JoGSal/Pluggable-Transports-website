As a tool developer, the fastest way to get up and running is by using [Dispatcher](https://github.com/OperatorFoundation/shapeshifter-dispatcher
), a tool developed by [The Operator Foundation](https://operatorfoundation.org/).  From Dispatcher's [README](https://github.com/OperatorFoundation/shapeshifter-dispatcher/blob/master/README.md):

"The Shapeshifter project provides network protocol shapeshifting technology (also sometimes referred to as obfuscation). The purpose of this technology is to change the characteristics of network traffic so that it is not identified and subsequently blocked by network filtering devices.

There are two components to Shapeshifter: transports and the dispatcher. Each transport provide different approach to shapeshifting. These transports are provided as a Go library which can be integrated directly into applications. The dispatcher is a command line tool which provides a proxy that wraps the transport library. It has several different proxy modes and can proxy both TCP and UDP traffic.

If you are a tool developer working in the Go programming language, then you probably want to use the transports library directly in your application. https://github.com/OperatorFoundation/shapeshifter-transports

If you want a end user that is trying to circumvent filtering on your network or you are a developer that wants to add pluggable transports to an existing tool that is not written in the Go programming language, then you probably want the dispatcher. Please note that familiarity with executing programs on the command line is necessary to use this tool. [â€¦] 

The purpose of the dispatcher is to provide different proxy interfaces to using transports. Through the use of these proxies, application traffic can be sent over the network in a shapeshifted form that bypasses network filtering, allowing the application to work on networks where it would otherwise be blocked or heavily throttled.

The dispatcher currently supports the following proxy modes:

* SOCKS5 (with optional PT 1.0 authentication protocol)
* Transparent TCP
* Transparent UDP
* STUN UDP

The dispatcher currently supports the following transports:

* meek
* obfs4
* obfs3
* obfs2
* scramblesuit
"

Please note that obfs2 and obfs3 should only be used for testing/educational exploration. Learn more about these and other transports in the [Transport Library](/transports/)
